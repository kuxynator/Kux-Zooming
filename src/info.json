  "description": "This mod allows to heavily customise the zooming behaviour, in particular it allows to:\n - change how far you can zoom out (and still see the world)\n - change how aggressive the zooming is (equivalent to changing mouse wheel sensitivity)\n - change at what position and zoom level the map opens\n - zoom in or out instantly with a single key stroke\nSee homepage/mod portal/readme for a full explanation of how this mod works. Please report any bugs and usability issues you find to help make this mod better - your feedback is much appreciated. Based on Zooming Reinvented by Jarcionek",
